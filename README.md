The three functionalities implemented are: 

1.Build forms dynamically using JavaScript to add/remove text inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons. 

2.Create interactive data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination features for large datasets. 

3.Highlight long words (over 8 characters) in a paragraph with a colored background.

The execution starts from exercise1.html

At first, when you open the page, Task 1 will be shown. You'll notice two buttons on each page: "Previous Task" and "Next Task". These buttons help you move between the tasks quickly. Overall, there are three tasks in total. So, if you're on Task 1 and click "Next Task", you'll move to Task 2. If you're on Task 3 and click "Previous Task", you'll go back to Task 2. This navigation setup makes it easier to switch between the tasks
